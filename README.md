# telescope-sourcegraph.nvim

(This repo is mostly vaporware at the moment. I'm exploring how to integrate sourcegraph within neovim via telescope)

Most up-to-date demo: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCyBnAx-4Q4)

You can see it "in action" (doesn't do as much as I'd like at the moment) [here](https://youtu.be/iCdsD6MiLQs)

If you want to test it (and recognize there will be breaking changes) you will need to install:

- github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli

## TODO:

(still have a few more ideas floating in my head)

- `async_lib` v2 in plenary
- `async_lib` jobs in plenary

Optional:

- combine with telescope `git_commits`, etc.
