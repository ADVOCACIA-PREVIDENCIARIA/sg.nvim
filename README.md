# sg.nvim

sg.nvim is a plugin focused on bringing many of the features of sourcegraph.com into Neovim.

## Implemented Features:

- Reading files by pasting sourcegraph.com links into nvim
  - Will currently cache the files locally so that the next time you read them it will be fast.
- Jump-to-definition using builtin LSP + src-cli (documentation pending)
- References using builtin LSP + src-cli (documentation pending)


## Demos:

## Installation

Don't install it yet. I will fix up a few things and then write installation
and setup instructions (including how to connect builtin LSP to this).
