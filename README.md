# telescope-sourcegraph.nvim

(This repo is mostly vaporware at the moment. I'm exploring how to integrate sourcegraph within neovim via telescope)

## TODO:

(still have a few more ideas floating in my head)

- `async_lib` v2 in plenary
- `async_lib` jobs in plenary

Optional:

- combine with telescope `git_commits`, etc.
