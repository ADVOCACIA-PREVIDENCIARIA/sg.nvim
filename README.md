# telescope-sourcegraph.nvim

(This repo is mostly vaporware at the moment. I'm exploring how to integrate sourcegraph within neovim via telescope)

You can see it "in action" (doesn't do as much as I'd like at the moment) [here](https://youtu.be/iCdsD6MiLQs)

## TODO:

(still have a few more ideas floating in my head)

- `async_lib` v2 in plenary
- `async_lib` jobs in plenary

Optional:

- combine with telescope `git_commits`, etc.
